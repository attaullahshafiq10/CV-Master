# CV Master

If you have ever tried to build a Resume or CVe using a MS word platform or like this, you know it takes time and the results are not always satisfactory.

The goal of CV-Master is to provide a quick and easy way to build a high quality CV, while still enabling custom layout if desired.

### Motivation
I created this template as managing a resume on Google Docs was hard and changing any formatting was too difficult since it had to be applied in multiple places. Most currently available templates either focus on two columns, or are multiple pages long. I personally found the two-column templates hard to focus while multiple-page resumes were just too long to be used in career fairs.


### Credit
LaTeX is a fantastic typesetting program that a lot of people use these days, especially the math and computer science people in academia.

LaTeX FontAwesome is bindings for FontAwesome icons to be used in XeLaTeX.

Roboto is the default font on Android and ChromeOS, and the recommended font for Googleâ€™s visual language, Material Design.

Source Sans Pro is a set of OpenType fonts that have been designed to work well in user interface (UI) environments.

You are free to take my .tex file and modify it to create your own resume. Please don't use my resume for anything else without my permission, though!
